Microsoft recently annonced the release of [DirectML](https://github.com/microsoft/directml), which allows you to train ML models on Windows machines that have GPUs other than NVidia (such as Radeon or Intel). This folder contains examples of using DirectML with Pytorch.

**NOTE:**
* Please install Pytorch & DirectML first
* These examples also use torchmetrics and torchsummary
