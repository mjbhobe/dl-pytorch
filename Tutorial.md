# Pytorch Toolkit - Tutorial
Thank you for your interest in the `Pytorch Toolkit`. I wrote this as a set of utility functions & classes that will ease the process of training, evaluating & running predictions from a model. As a developer, I would rather spend my time productively concentrating on the core tasks of ML - viz. preparing data, designing/re-using appropriate model architecture and tuning the hyperparameters to get the best performance from the model. Keras does a great job of hiding boilerplate code for training the model, evaluating performance and running predictions. I aim to bring the ease that Keras provides to Pytorch via the `Pytorch Toolkit`. Most of the API is similar to the Keras API, so Keras users should find it very easy to understand.

|**NOTE**|
|:---|
|<font color='firebrick'>This tutorial is **work-in-progress** and is expected to change to some extend, especially if I enhance the `Pytorch Toolkit` with more functions. Do keep checking back for changes - I don't expect the API to change drastically henceforth</font>|

This tutorial will gradually expose you to the API provided by the **Pytorch Toolkit**, so it is best that you **follow along from beginning to the end**. I use a very informal style of writing, which I hope you'll like. The API is inspired by Keras, so if you have used Keras before you'll feel at home.

I am assuming that you have already installed the pre-requisites and have done the preliminary test as explained in the [Readme](Readme.md) file - if not, please do so now.

|**A Point To Note**|
|:---|
|This is NOT an ML tutorial - I don't _teach_ you how to create the best model, training techniques, data loading & preparation techniques etc. This tutorial is _strictly aimed_ at showing you how to use the `Pytorch Toolkit` and nothing more!|

 With that perspective, let's get started.

## Training with data available in Numpy arrays
Often data & labels are available in Numpy arrays, especially for structured datasets. For example: datasets available with the `scikit-learn` module (like Iris dataset, Boston Housing, the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset etc.) and in several repositories on Kaggle and UCI. 

We'll start with one such example, specifically a binary classification problem - classifying the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. I'll be downloading the data from the [UCI Repository link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)), but you can load it from the `scikit-learn datasets` module as well.

For complete code listing see [Wisconsin Breast Cancer](pyt_breast_cancer.py) code file.

### Loading data
This section _does not strictly pertain to the Pytorch Toolkit API_, but I am showing the code nonetheless so you have some perspective on how our model can be easily trained on data & labels available as Numpy Arrays. Here is the code I used to load the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset - I am not providing detailed instructions here (as it does not pertain to the Pytorch toolkit)

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# loading & preparing data
url = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data'

cols = [
    "id","diagnosis","radius_mean","texture_mean","perimeter_mean","area_mean",
    "smoothness_mean","compactness_mean","concavity_mean","concave points_mean",
    "symmetry_mean","fractal_dimension_mean","radius_se","texture_se","perimeter_se",
    "area_se","smoothness_se","compactness_se","concavity_se","concave points_se",
    "symmetry_se","fractal_dimension_se","radius_worst","texture_worst","perimeter_worst",
    "area_worst","smoothness_worst","compactness_worst","concavity_worst",
    "concave points_worst","symmetry_worst","fractal_dimension_worst"
]

df = pd.read_csv(url, header=None, names=cols, index_col=0)
# map 'M' (malignant) to 1 and 'B' (benign) to 0
df['diagnosis'] = df['diagnosis'].map({'M':1, 'B':0})

# grab the data & labels - these will be Numpy arrays!
X = df.drop(['diagnosis'], axis=1).values
y = df['diagnosis'].values

# split into train/test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = \
    train_test_split(X, y, test_size=test_split, random_state=seed)

# scale data using Standard scaling
ss = StandardScaler()
X_train = ss.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = ss.transform(X_test)
```

### Creating our model
You would normally create your Pytorch model by deriving your class from `nn.Module`, somewhat as follows:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class WBCNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, inp_size, hidden1, hidden2, num_classes):
        super(WBCNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(inp_size, hidden1)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden1, hidden2)
        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()
        self.out = nn.Linear(hidden2, num_classes)
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self, inp):
        x = self.fc1(inp)
        x = self.relu1(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        x = self.relu2(x)
        x = self.out(x)
        x = self.sigmoid(x)
        return x

# instantiate the model
model = WBCNet(32, 32, 10)
```

With the `Pytorch Toolkit` the **only change** you make is to the base class from which you derive the module. I provide a class called `PytkModule`, which derives from `nn.Module`. This class provides additional functions to help with model training, evaluation and testing. Here is how you'll define your Module when using the Pytorch Toolkit:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Change #1 -> import the Pytorch toolkit
import pytorch_toolkit as pytk

# Change #2 -> change the base class from nn.Module to pytk.PytkModule
class WBCNet(pytk.PytkModule):
    def __init__(self, inp_size, hidden1, hidden2, num_classes):
        super(WBCNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(inp_size, hidden1)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden1, hidden2)
        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()
        self.out = nn.Linear(hidden2, num_classes)
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self, inp):
        x = self.fc1(inp)
        x = self.relu1(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        x = self.relu2(x)
        x = self.out(x)
        x = self.sigmoid(x)
        return x

# instantiate the model
model = WBCNet(32, 32, 10)
```

Notice that **the only change you made was the base class from which your model is derived!**. You code the constructor `__init__(...)` and the `forward(...)` method exactly the same way as before! 

Before you can start training the module, you'll need to specify the `loss` function, the `optimizer` and `metrics` to track during the training epochs (Yes! The `Pytorch Toolkit` provides several common metrics that you can use out-of the box - like Accuracy, F1-Score, MSE, MAE etc., which you can use). 

|**NOTE**|
|:---|
|At this time there is no support to add your own metrics - something that I plan on adding at a future date. However, I do include the most common metrics that I normally use during training. So, hopefully, this omission does not prove to be a major impediment.|

```python
# instantiate the loss function & optimizer (nothing PyTk specific here)
loss_fn = nn.BCELoss() 
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001,
    nesterov=True, weight_decay=0.005, momentum=0.9, dampening=0) 
```

and this is how you _attach_ these to your model using it's `compile()` method:

```python
# NOTE: model is an instance of PytkModule class
# it provides a compile() method, which allows me to specify the loss function, the optimizer 
# and metrics to track when training
model.compile(loss=loss_fn, optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['acc'])
```

* Notice that the above line is very Keras-like (I've done this on purpose). Keras does a lot more with it's `compile(...)` method. I merely set attributes of the `PytkModule` derived class! 
* You can _optionally specify_ one or more metrics that the training loop should track using the `metrics` parameter of the `compile()` method. Metrics are specified using their associated string aliases (just like in Keras) - refer to the table below for supported metrics.
* You _need not specify any metrics_ (for example by omitting the optional`metrics` parameter in above call). 

|**NOTE**|
|:---|
|The training loop will **always track** the `loss` metric though, _even if you leave out the metrics parameter in the `compile()` call_.<br/>The `loss` metric is always tracked _in addition to any other metrics you supply_ in the metrics parameter.<br/> Additionally, you don't have to specifically mention the `loss` metric explicitly in your `metrics` parameter.|


**Table of available metrics**

|String Alias | Metric | 
|:---|:---|
|`'acc'`| Accuracy (works for binary and multiclass classification)|
|`'prec'`| Precision|
|`'rec'`| Recall|
|`'f1'`| F1 Score|
|`'roc_auc'`| ROC AUC Score|
|`'mse'`| Mean Square Error (for regression)|
|`'rmse'`| Root Mean Square Error (for regression)|
|`'mae'`| Mean Absolute Error (for regression)|

### Training our model
Here is where the Pytorch Tooklit shines - **you don't have to write the code that loops through epochs, generates batches of data etc. etc.** - just call the model's `fit(...)` method as shown below:

```python
hist = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=16)
```

The `fit(...)` method takes many more parameters, which I will cover as we progress through this tutorial. At the minumum, you need to specify the X (data), y (labels) [both Numpy arrays], the number of epochs to loop through and the batch size to use. You should see output like the one shown below (output has been truncated for brevity).

```
Epoch (  1/100): (455/455) -> loss: 0.6900 - acc: 0.6296
Epoch (  2/100): (455/455) -> loss: 0.6696 - acc: 0.6373
...
... many more lines (truncated)
...
Epoch ( 99/100): (455/455) -> loss: 0.0512 - acc: 0.9871
Epoch (100/100): (455/455) -> loss: 0.0506 - acc: 0.9871
```
The output should be fairly easy to comprehend, especially if you have used Keras before. Each line shows the epoch wise progress of training loop - this is followed by by record count and then the metrics you specified (here `loss` and `acc`) - `loss` will be tracked even if you don't specify any metrics.

### Cross-training with validation data
It is always a good practice to cross-train your model on a `training` dataset and an `evaluation` dataset. You can easily accomplish this with the Pytorch Toolkit as shown below. Just modify the `fit(...)` call as follows:

```python
hist = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=16, 
                 validation_split=0.20)
```

The `validation_split` parameter takes a value between `0.0` and `1.0`. The `X_train` & `y_train` training data & labels (Numpy arrays) are internally split into `training` and `cross-validation` datasets using the `validation_split` proportion specified. For example, in the above call, the `X_train` & `y_train` get randomly split in a 80%:20% proportion, with 20% getting assigned as the cross-validation data & labels. Output from the training loop will be slightly different, as shown below:

```
Epoch (  1/100): (364/364) -> loss: 0.6926 - acc: 0.6196 - val_loss: 0.6790 - val_acc: 0.6884
Epoch (  2/100): (364/364) -> loss: 0.6771 - acc: 0.6214 - val_loss: 0.6638 - val_acc: 0.6884
...
... many more (truncated)
...
Epoch ( 99/100): (364/364) -> loss: 0.0496 - acc: 0.9891 - val_loss: 0.0974 - val_acc: 0.9688
Epoch (100/100): (364/364) -> loss: 0.0489 - acc: 0.9891 - val_loss: 0.0971 - val_acc: 0.9688
```
Notice that metrics are now being tracked for the `training` data & labels as well as the `cross-validation` data and labels (values preceedes by `val_`)

### Using a _decicated_ validation dataset
Sometimes validation data & labels are available in separate Numpy arrays (let's say we call these `X_val` and `y_val` for the data and labels respectively). To use these, make the following change to the `fit(...)` call, as shown below:

```python
hist = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=16, 
                 validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
```

We have asked the model to to use `X_val` and `y_val` as the cross-validation data & labels by passing them as a tuple via the `validation_data` parameter. We don't use `validation_split` parameter in this case. 

|**NOTE**|
|:---|
|If both `validation_split` and `validation_data` are specified in the `fit()` call, then the `validation_dataset` parameter takes precedence and `validation_split` is simply ignored.|

### Tracking Multiple Metrics
Suppose you want to track `accuracy` and `F1-Score` by epoch. Here is what you do:

* Specify the metrics you want to track in your `model.compile(...)` call as follows (for metric aliases please refer to table above):

```python
model.compile(loss=loss_fn, optimizer=optimizer, 
              metrics=['acc', 'f1'])
```

* Call `fit(...)` as usual - no changes here!

```python
hist = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=16, 
                 validation_split=0.20)
```

You should see output like the following - notice the extra metric being tracked for the `training` and `cross-validation` datasets.

```
Epoch (  1/100): (364/364) -> loss: 0.6926 - acc: 0.6196 - f1: 0.0488 - val_loss: 0.6790 - val_acc: 0.6884 - val_f1: 0.0000
Epoch (  2/100): (364/364) -> loss: 0.6771 - acc: 0.6214 - f1: 0.0696 - val_loss: 0.6638 - val_acc: 0.6884 - val_f1: 0.0000
...
... many more
...
Epoch ( 99/100): (364/364) -> loss: 0.0496 - acc: 0.9891 - f1: 0.9868 - val_loss: 0.0974 - val_acc: 0.9688 - val_f1: 0.9681
Epoch (100/100): (364/364) -> loss: 0.0489 - acc: 0.9891 - f1: 0.9844 - val_loss: 0.0971 - val_acc: 0.9688 - val_f1: 0.9681
```

### Viewing model's performance across epochs
The `Pytorch Toolkit` provides a `show_plots(...)` function which plots the `loss` and `acc` (if specified) againsts epochs. This will quickly help you ascertain if your model if overfitting or underfitting the data it is trained on. 

The `fit(...)` call returns a `history` object, which is basically a map of all the metrics tracked across the various epochs (e.g. `hist['loss']` is a `list` of `loss` per epoch. So if you specified `epochs=100` in your `fit(...)` call, this would point to a list of 100 values and so on).

**After training is completed**, use the following call:

```python
pytk.show_plots(hist)
```

`show_plots(...)` is passed the value returned by `fit(...)` call. Since we specified the `acc` metric in our `model.compile(...)` call, the `fit(...)` call was tracking both `loss` and `acc`. The output if `show_plots(...)` will be something like below - on the left is the plot of loss vs epochs (for both the training & cross-validation datasets) and on the right is the plot for `acc` against epochs.

![](images/show_plots.png)

|NOTE|
|:---|
|In this version of the `Pytorch Toolkit`, the `show_plot()` function plots _only_ the `loss` and `acc` (if specified) metrics. I'll be adding support to plot other metrics in upcoming versions. For now, this suffices for most problems.|

### Evaluating Model performance
Once you are done with training, you will want to verify model's performance on `testing` data & labels, which the model _has not seen_ during the entire cross-training process. This can be done as follows:

```python
# assuming you are tracking both accuracy & f1-score metrics
loss, acc, f1 = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'  Test dataset  -> loss: {loss:.4f} - acc: {acc:.4f} - f1: {f1:.4f}')
```

You'll see something like the following:

```
Evaluating (114/114) -> loss: 0.0622 - acc: 0.9922 - f1: 0.9906
  Test dataset  -> loss: 0.0622 - acc: 0.9922 - f1: 0.9906
```

|NOTE|
|:---|
|The `evaluate(...)` call returns _as many values_ as the metrics you are tracking during training. Recall that the `fit(...)` call **always** tracks `loss` even if you don't explicitly specify it in the metrics list! of the `compile(...)` call. We also specified `acc` and `f1`, hence we'll get back 3 values.|

You can always evaluate model's performance on any dataset - for example, to evaluate performance on the training set, use the following code:

```python
# assuming you are tracking both accuracy & f1-score metrics
loss, acc, f1 = model.evaluate(X_train, y_train)
print(f'  Train dataset  -> loss: {loss:.4f} - acc: {acc:.4f} - f1: {f1:.4f}')
```
You should see output similar to the one shown above.

### Saving the model's state:
Once you are happy with the model's performance, you may want to save the model's weights and structure to disk, so you can just load this at a later date and use the model without having to re-train it. The `PytModule` provides a `save()` method to do just that. Use it on an instance of the model as follows:

```python
# specify path of file where model state should be saved
model.save('./model_states/wbc.pt')
```

`save()` takes a path to file where the model state is saved - if the directory leading up to the path does not exist, it is created the very first time `save()` is called. You need not specify the `.pt` extension is optional - it will be tagged on to file name. **The `.pt` file is a binary file, which only Pytorch API can comprehend.**

### Loading model's state from disk
The `Pytorch Toolkit` provides a **stand alone** `load()` function to load the model's state from disk - I could have coded this as a static function of the PytModule class, but I chose to code a stand-alone function instead. Here is how you use it.

```python
# NOTE: load() is a stand-alone function and not a class member function!
model = pytk.load_model('./model_states/wbc.pt')
```
This call will load the model's structure as well as the weights & biases of the various layers of the model. It is ready-to-go!

### Running Predictions
Once you have trained the model and are satisfied with the performace, you will run predictions on the _test_ data and labels (or even on the _training_ data and labels). Use the `predict(...)` call as follows:

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

**NOTE:**
* For a _binary classification_ problem, such as this one, `y_pred` is a Numpy array of shape `(X_train.shape[0], 1)` (i.e. has as many rows as `X_train` but just 1 column)
* For a _multi-class classification_ problem, with `N` possible output classes, `y_pred` will be a Numpy array of shape `(X_train.shape[0], N)`

This completes our first example - please refer to the code for [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Classification](pyt_breast_cancer.py) example for the complete code.

### Multiclass Classifiction with data & labels in Numpy Arrays
There is **absolutely no change** in the way you would train, evaluate and test a model's performance for multi-class classification. You may need to change the way you prepare data, and most probably create a model with a different architecture (no of layers, types of layers etc.). I have included multi-class classification problems on Numpy arrays in the Github repository:

* Refer to the [Iris Flower Classification](pyt_iris.py) example, which classifies 4 flower species depending on various sepal & petal attributes.
* Also see the [Wine Classification](pyt_wine.py) Python file for another example.

## Training with Pytorch Datasets & Transforms
Pytorch provides powerful `dataset` and `transforms` classes in its `torchvision` package. These are indespensible, especially for image classification problems. The 
`Pytorch Toolkit` provides equivalent functions `fit_dataset(...)`, `evaluate_dataset(...)` and `predict_dataset(...)` that allow you to seamlessly work with `torchvision` datasets. As before, let's walk through an example - this is the MNIST digits classification example, for which we can use either an Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) or a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

For the complete code used in this section, refer to the [MNIST Classification](pyt_mnist_dnn.py) example.

### Loading data
Again, this section _does not strictly pertain to the Pytorch Toolkit API_, but I am showing the code nonetheless so you have some perspective on how the data is loaded using `torchvision.datasets` and `torchvision.transforms`

```python
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

# transform data to Pytorch Tensors
transformations = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(),])

# download the training & test datasets, if required, and apply transforms
train_dataset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, 
                               transform=transformations) 
print("No of training records: %d" % len(train_dataset))

test_dataset = datasets.MNIST('./data', train=False, download=True, 
                              transform=transformations)
print("No of test records: %d" % len(test_dataset))

# Randomly split the 10,000 records in the training datsset in ratio of 8000:2000 records, 
# which we assign to the training & cross-validation datasets respectively
val_dataset, test_dataset = torch.utils.data.random_split(test_dataset, [8000, 2000])
print("No of cross-val records: %d" % len(val_dataset))
print("No of test records: %d" % len(test_dataset))
```

### Building our model
This is straight forward - as before we derive our model from `pytk.PytkModule`.

```python
import pytorch_tooklit as pytk

# some globals - MNIST digits dataset as 28x28 black & white images
IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH, NUM_CLASSES = 28, 28, 1
# we are classifying 10 classes corresponding to 10 digits 0-9
NUM_CLASSES = 10

# a multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) network
class MNISTNet(pyt.PytModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MNISTNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = pytk.Linear(IMAGE_HEIGHT * IMAGE_WIDTH * NUM_CHANNELS, 128)
        self.fc2 = pytk.Linear(128, 64)
        self.out = pytk.Linear(64, NUM_CLASSES)

    def forward(self, x):
        # flatten input (for DNN)
        x = pyt.Flatten(x)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        # NOTE: nn.CrossEntropyLoss() includes a logsoftmax call, which applies a softmax
        # function to outputs. So, don't apply one yourself!
        # x = F.softmax(self.out(x), dim=1)  # -- don't do this!
        x = self.out(x)
        return x

# instantiate the model
model = MNISTNet()
```

The astute observer will notice that I have used `pytk.Linear()` instead of `nn.Linear()`. This is a function implemented in `pytorch_toolkit.py` as follows:

```python
def Linear(in_nodes, out_nodes, bias=True):
    layer = nn.Linear(in_nodes, out_nodes, bias)
    # initialize weights with xavier_uniform and bias layer to all-zeros
    torch.nn.init.xavier_uniform_(layer.weight)
    if bias: torch.nn.init.zeros_(layer.bias)
    return layer
```
So all it's doing is adding _initializing code_ to the weights & bias of the layer - weights are initialized using `xavier_uniform()` (same as `glorot_uniform()` from Keras) and the bias layer (if used) is initialized to all-zeros. You can use `nn.Linear()` instead of `pyt.Linear()` if you prefer the initialization that Pytorch uses by default.

If you prefer to use `Conv2d` layers instead, your module could be defined somewhat like the following:

```python
class MNISTConvNet(pytk.PytkModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MNISTConvNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = pytk.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=5)
        self.conv2 = pytk.Conv2d(32, 32, kernel_size=5)
        self.conv3 = pytk.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=5)
        self.fc1 = pytk.Linear(1*1*64, 256)
        self.out = pytk.Linear(256, NUM_CLASSES)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.max_pool2d(F.relu(self.conv1(x)), 2)
        x = F.dropout(x, p=0.5, training=self.training)
        x = F.max_pool2d(F.relu(self.conv2(x)), 2)
        x = F.dropout(x, p=0.5, training=self.training)
        x = F.max_pool2d(F.relu(self.conv3(x)),2)
        x = F.dropout(x, p=0.5, training=self.training)
        # flatten input (for DNN)
        x = pytk.Flatten(x)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.dropout(x, training=self.training)
        # NOTE: nn.CrossEntropyLoss() includes a logsoftmax call, which applies a softmax
        # function to outputs. So, don't apply one yourself!
        # x = F.softmax(self.out(x), dim=1)  # -- don't do this!
        x = self.out(x)
        return x

# instantiate the model
model = MNISTConvNet()
```
Again, you'll notice that I have used `pytk.Conv2d()` instead of `nn.Conv2d()`. Just like in the previous case, this implements the added step of initializing a `nn.Conv2d()` layer's weights with `xavier_uniform()` (or `glorot_uniform()` for Keras users) and the layer's bias to all-zeros.

I also include a utility function `pytk.Flatten()`, which flattens the previous Conv2d (a 3D layer) into a 2D layer, which can then be fed into a `nn.Linear` layer. `pytk.Flatten()` is implemented as below:

```python
def Flatten(x):
    return x.view(x.shape[0],-1)
```

As before, we need to call the `compile()` method of the model, passing in a loss function, an optimizer and metrics we want to track. Here is the code for the same:

```python
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(params=model.parameters(), lr=0.01, weight_decay=0.0005)
model.compile(loss=loss_fn, optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['acc'])
```

### Training model using datasets
Since we are using Pytorch datasets API, training, evaluating and testing the model will use different functions of the model class.

To train the model, call the `fit_dataset(...)` method as follows:

```python
hist = model.fit_dataset(train_dataset, 
                         validation_dataset=val_dataset, 
                         epochs=NUM_EPOCHS, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE)
```
This is almost similar to the `fit()` call - instead of passing `X_train/y_train` Numpy arrays, we pass datasets `train_dataset` and `val_dataset`. Output is similar to the one you saw with the `fit()` call.

```
Training on 60000 samples, cross-validating on 8000 samples
Epoch ( 1/25): (60000/60000) -> loss: 0.2446 - acc: 0.9285 - val_loss: 0.1272 - val_acc: 0.9617
Epoch ( 2/25): (60000/60000) -> loss: 0.1128 - acc: 0.9660 - val_loss: 0.0955 - val_acc: 0.9701
...
... many more records
...
Epoch (24/25): (60000/60000) -> loss: 0.0159 - acc: 0.9984 - val_loss: 0.0507 - val_acc: 0.9839
Epoch (25/25): (60000/60000) -> loss: 0.0159 - acc: 0.9984 - val_loss: 0.0509 - val_acc: 0.9845
```
|NOTE|
|:---|
|The `validation_dataset` parameter is optional - omit it if you do not want to use a validation dataset. However, it is a good practice to cross-train model|

### Evaluating model's performance on test dataset
To get an unbiased view of the model's performance, we should evaluate it against `test dataset` that the model has not _seen_ during the entire training process. Notice that we have not used `test_dataset` so far. To evaluate model performance using Pytorch datasets, use the following call:

```python
loss, acc = model.evaluate_dataset(test_dataset)
print('  Test dataset -> loss: %.4f - acc: %.4f' % (loss, acc))
```

As before, the `evaluate_dataset()` will return _as may values as the number of metrics_ you specify in the `compile()` call. **The `loss` metric will always be tracked even if you do not specify it in the metrics list**. Output of the above call is something like shown below:

```
Evaluating (2000/2000) -> loss: 0.0642 - acc: 0.9790
  Test dataset -> loss: 0.0642 - acc: 0.9790
```

### Making Predictions
To make predictions after training our model using a Pytorch `dataset`, call the `model.predict_dataset(...)` method as shown below:

```python
y_pred, y_true = model.predict_dataset(test_dataset)
y_pred = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)
print('We got %d/%d incorrect!' % ((y_pred != y_true).sum(), len(y_true)))
```
Notice that this function returns 2 values (**both Numpy arrays**) - the predictions (`y_pred`) and the actual values (`y_true`). `y_pred.shape = (X_train.shape[0], NUM_CLASSES)`, hence the following `np.argmax(...)` call to reduce the dimension to 1 along the columns. `y_pred` will have shape of `(X_train.shape[0],)` so the `np.argmax(...)` call is not required for `y_true`.

Output from the above function is something like below:

```
Sample labels (50):  [7 8 3 6 9 4 5 7 2 2 3 5 0 0 3 3 0 8 2 9 8 2 4 8 8 5 1 3 6 3 1 2 3 7 4 7 3 8 7 7 9 9 3 9 0 7 7 1 4 0]
Sample predictions:  [7 8 3 6 9 4 5 7 2 2 3 5 0 0 3 3 0 8 2 9 8 2 4 8 8 5 1 3 6 3 1 2 3 7 4 7 3 8 7 7 9 9 3 9 0 7 7 1 4 0]
We got 43/2000 incorrect!
```

### Using Learning Rate Schedulers during training
Often it is useful to step the learning as epochs increase to prevent the model from overshooting the global minima as it tries to descend towards it. There are several learning rate schedulers that the Pytorch library supplies - we can use anyone of them.

I normally use the `StepLR` learning rate scheduler, which I instantiate as follows:

```python
# instantiate your preferred learning rate scheduler
# reduce LR every 10th epoch by 0.2 times
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size=10, gamma=0.2)
```
where, `optimizer` points to the optimizer we use with our model.

To use the scheduler when training, we supply it via the `lr_scheduler` parameter of the `fit()` or the `fit_dataset()` methods of our `PytkModule`. 

For example, to use this with the Wisconsin Breast Cancer example, I would use the following `fit()` call

```python
# for the Wisconsin Breast Cancer example
hist = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=16,
                 validation_split=0.20, lr_scheduler=scheduler)
```
and with the MNIST example, where we use datasets, the call would be as follows:

```python
# for the Wisconsin Breast Cancer example
hist = model.fit_dataset(train_dataset, validation_dataset=val_dataset, 
                         epochs=NUM_EPOCHS, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, 
                         lr_scheduler=scheduler)
```

For the complete code used in this section, refer to the [MNIST Classification](pyt_mnist_dnn.py) example, where you can train/evaluate/test both MLP and CNN architectures.

## Using `nn.Sequential` API
Personally I find using the traditional method, i.e. deriving your class from nn.Module, a bit tedious. I'll admit that I have spent hours debugging issues with my `forward()` method - I simply could never get it right the first time. The `nn.Sequential` API provided by Pytorch was a life-saver for me. It helps me clearly _visualize_ the sequence of operations in my module and what's mofe - I don't have to write a `forward()` method - how convenient!

In this section I'll cover how we can use the `Pytorch Toolkit` with models created with the `nn.Sequential` API. I'll illustrate this with a multiclass classification problem, specifically classification of 10 image classes of the `CIFAR10` imagesets. You can get more information about the CIFAR10 datasets [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

### Loading Data
As before, this section _does not strictly apply to the `Pytorch Toolkit`_. For loading the `CIFAR10` images data, I use the following code - data (images & labels) is returned as torchvision datasets.

```python
def load_data():
    """
    Load the data using datasets API. 
    We apply some random transforms to training datset as we load the data
    We also split the test_dataset into cross-val/test datasets using 80:20 ratio
    """
    IMGNET_MEAN, IMGNET_STD = 0.5, 0.3  # approximate values

    xforms = {
        'train' : [
            # add transforms here - scaling, shearing, flipping etc.
            transforms.RandomCrop(32, padding=4),
            transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),   
            transforms.ToTensor(),
            transforms.Normalize((IMGNET_MEAN, IMGNET_MEAN, IMGNET_MEAN),
                                 (IMGNET_STD, IMGNET_STD, IMGNET_STD))
        ],
        'test' : [
            transforms.ToTensor(),
            transforms.Normalize((IMGNET_MEAN, IMGNET_MEAN, IMGNET_MEAN),
                                 (IMGNET_STD, IMGNET_STD, IMGNET_STD))
        ],
    }

    train_dataset = datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True,
                                     transform=transforms.Compose(xforms['train']))
    print("No of training records: %d" % len(train_dataset))

    test_dataset = datasets.CIFAR10('./data', download=True, train=False,
                                    transform=transforms.Compose(xforms['test']))
    print("No of test records: %d" % len(test_dataset))

    # randomly split the 10,000 records in the test dataset into cross-validation &
    # test datasets in a 80:20 ratio
    val_dataset, test_dataset = torch.utils.data.random_split(test_dataset, [8000, 2000])
    print("No of cross-val records: %d" % len(val_dataset))
    print("No of test records: %d" % len(test_dataset))

    return train_dataset, val_dataset, test_dataset


# load the data
train_dataset, val_dataset, test_dataset = load_data()
```

### Building the model
Building the model is a two step process:
* Build the model using the `nn.Sequential` API as usual
* Wrap the model using the `PytkModelWrapper` class provided by the `Pytorch Toolkit`

These steps are shown below:

```python
class Flatten(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, input):
        return input.view(input.size(0), -1)

def build_model(l1, l2, l3):
    # NOTE: l2, l2 & l3 are nodes for the 3 Conv2d layers 
    model = nn.Sequential(
        pytk.Conv2d(3, l1, 5, padding=1),
        nn.ReLU(),
        nn.BatchNorm2d(l1),
        pytk.Conv2d(l1, l1, 5, padding=1),
        nn.ReLU(),
        nn.BatchNorm2d(l1),
        nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
        nn.Dropout(0.10),

        pytk.Conv2d(l1, l2, 5, padding=1),
        nn.ReLU(),
        nn.BatchNorm2d(l2),
        pytk.Conv2d(l2, l2, 5, padding=1),
        nn.ReLU(),
        nn.BatchNorm2d(l2),
        nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
        nn.Dropout(0.10),

        pytk.Conv2d(l2, l3, 3, padding=1),
        nn.ReLU(),
        nn.BatchNorm2d(l3),
        pytk.Conv2d(l3, l3, 3, padding=1),
        nn.ReLU(),
        nn.BatchNorm2d(l3),
        nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
        nn.Dropout(0.10),

        Flatten(),

        nn.Linear(2*2*l3, 512),
        nn.Dropout(0.20),        

        nn.Linear(512, 256),
        nn.Dropout(0.25),        

        nn.Linear(256, 10)
    )
    return model

# wrap our model using the PytkModuleWrapper class
model = pytk.PytkModuleWrapper(build_model(32, 64, 128))
```

The `PytkModuleWrapper` class provides the same functions that the `PytkModule` class provided - viz. `fit()`, `fit_dataset()`, `evaluate()`, `evaluate_dataset()` etc. It wraps around a module created with the `nn.Sequential` API, hence the name.

Once the module is created, you will assign it a loss function, an optimizer and (optionally) metrics to be tracked during the training loop - this is done the same was as shown with `PytkModule` class. Here is the code:

```python
LEARNING_RATE, L2_REG = 0.001, 0.0005
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(params=model.parameters(), lr=LEARNING_RATE, weight_decay=L2_REG)
model.compile(loss=loss_fn, optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['acc'])
```
In this example we are using the `Adam` optimizer and the `CrossEntropyLoss` loss function (as this is a multiclass classification problem). We choose to monitor the accuracy metric, with the `metrics=['acc']` parameter.

### Training the model
This is exactly as before, with the `PytkModule` derived class - just call the `fit_dataset()` (since we loaded data into datasets) on the instance of the model. Alternately, had you used Numpy arrays for data and labels, you would call `fit()` on the model instance.

```python
hist = model.fit_dataset(train_dataset, validation_dataset=val_dataset, 
                         epochs=NUM_EPOCHS, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE)
```

Alternatively, had you sourced data & labels as Numpy arrays instead of torchvision datasets, you would use the following call:

```python
# either using validation_split
hist = model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_split=0.2,
                 epochs=NUM_EPOCHS, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE)

# or using validation_data
hist = model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
                 epochs=NUM_EPOCHS, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE)
```

All the above calls return the same kind of `history` object as before, so you can plot your model's `loss` and `acc` curves as before:

```python
pytk.show_plots(hist)
```

### Evaluating model's performance
This is done exactly as before, using `evaluate_dataset()` or `evaluate()` on an instance of the model, depending on whether data is fed from Pytorch datasets of Numpy arrays respectively.

```python
loss, acc = model.evaluate_dataset(test_dataset)
print('  Test dataset -> loss: %.4f - acc: %.4f' % (loss, acc))
```

Or had you sourced data as Numpy arrays, you would use:

```python
loss, acc = model.evaluate(X_test)
print('  Test dataset -> loss: %.4f - acc: %.4f' % (loss, acc))
```

As with an instance of the `PytkModule` class, the `evaluate_dataset()` and `evaluate()` functions return as many values as the number of metrics tracked. Recall that `loss` is **ALWAYS** tracked. In our case, we also specified `acc` in the `compile()` method. So this call will return 2 values - for `loss` and `acc`.

### Saving the model state
This is also just as before. Call the `save()` function on an instance of the model class as below, passing it a full path to the file where model state is to be saved. Example shown below:

```python
# save model to ./model_states/cifar10.pt binary file
save_path = os.path.join('.','model_states','cifar10.pt')
model.save(save_path)
```

### Loading model state from disk
This is slightly different than before - just as construction was a 2 step process, so is loading the model state. Assuming you saved model state to `./model_states/cifar10.pt` file as shown above, you would reload it as follows:

```python
model = pytk.PytkModelWrapper(pytk.load_model(save_path))
# NOTE: save_path is the path from where model state is to be loaded
# Example - save_path = './model_states/cifar10.pt'
```
Now `model` points to an instance of `PytkModelWrapper` class and you can you all the functions like `fit()`, `fit_dataset()`, `evaluate()`, `evaluate_dataset()` etc. on it.

### Making Predictions
You make predictions the same way you did when using the `PytkModule` derived class.

```python
# when data is sourced from torchvision datasets (as in this example)
y_pred, y_true = model.predict_dataset(test_dataset)
```

```python
# when data is sourced from Numpy arrays
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

As before, `y_pred` and `y_true` are Numpy arrays. `y_pred.shape() -> (X_test.shape[0], NUM_CLASSES)`

### Using Early Stopping 
Frankly speaking, you don't really know how many epochs will be needed to train your model. I normally provide a very large value of epochs (e.g. 100), when I train my model for the very first time. However, in a lot of cases you'll realize that so many epochs are really not required. The model's performance stops improving after a certain number of epochs - typically `validation loss` stops improving (or flattens out). You would ideally like to stop the training here **and keep the model's state (i.e. weights & biases) intach at this point**. Enter the `EarlyStopping` class.

Here is how you use the `EarlyStopping` class:
* Instantiate an instance of the class (explained below) before calling `fit()` or `fit_dataset()`
* Pass this instance as the value of the `early_stopping` parameter of the `fit()` and `fit_dataset()` methods

For example:
```python
early_stopper = pytk.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=10, save_best_weights=True, verbose=False)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, 
          ....,  # other parameters...
          early_stopping=early_stopper)

# or, if using datasets
model.fit_dataset(train_dataset,
                  ....,  # other parameters...
                  early_stopping=early_stopper)
```

You specify the metric that the class with minitor (typically `val_loss`) and for how many epochs it should wait (`patience`) before stopping training if the monitored metric does not improve. As a good practice, you should always ask this class to save the best weights (with `save_best_weights=True`). After training is stopped, the model's best weights are restored from this saved state. If you also want to see how the `EarlyStopping` class is monitoring your metric, set `verbose=True` - it is `False` by default.

How this works: Suppose you monitor `val_loss` (with `monitor='val_loss'`) for `patience=5`, then the `EarlyStopping` class will keep a log of the `val_loss` across each epoch. `val_loss` is expected to keep decresing as epochs increase. But normally it goes up & down slightly. If it does not decrease for 5 epochs in a row (since `patience=5`), it indicates that the `val_loss` is not _improving_. So training is stopped at this point!

## Using Transfer Learning for Image Classification
Transfer learning involves using the weights & biases of a pre-trained model for your specific task. Some examples of pre-trained models are VGG16, ResNet etc. Pytorch ships with a lot or pretrained models in its `torchvision.models` package - for a complete list, see [this link](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html).

In this section I am going to show you how to use the VGG16 pre-trained model for an image classification task. I am going to use it on a [Kaggle Fruits360 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits/version/2), which has fruit images for 120 classes.

For the complete code see the Jupyter Notebook ???

### Preparing the data
Download the dataset from this link and unzip it to any folder (e.g. `~/tmp`). It creates a directory structure like shown below - there are 120 sub-directories each under the `Test` and `Training` folders; the image is showing only the partial set.

![](images/fruits360.png)

Such an organization presents the perfect scenario for using the `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` class for loading the images. `ImageFolder` is a dataset!!

Here is the code I used to load the images:

```python
# define locations of the images (root folders)
train_folder_root = '/tmp/fruits-360_dataset/fruits-360/Training'
test_folder_root = '/tmp/fruits-360_dataset/fruits-360/Test'

IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH, NUM_CHANNELS = 100, 100, 3

# transforms to apply
simple_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Scale((IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
])

from torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder

# ImageFolder is a dataset - how convenient!! :)
train_dataset = ImageFolder(train_folder_root, simple_transforms)
eval_dataset = ImageFolder(test_folder_root, simple_transforms)

# split eval_dataset into eval & test datasets 70:30
num_eval_recs = int(0.70 * len(eval_dataset))
num_test_recs = len(eval_dataset) - num_eval_recs

eval_dataset, test_dataset = \
    torch.utils.data.random_split(eval_dataset, 
        [num_eval_recs, num_test_recs])

print("No of training records: %d" % len(train_dataset))
print("No of cross-val records: %d" % len(eval_dataset))
print("No of test records: %d" % len(test_dataset))
```

### Using the pre-trained VGG16 model
Following is the Pytorch code to use pre-trained instance of the VGG16 model (the very first call will download weights of the model).

```python
from torchvision import models
vgg16_base = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
print(vgg16_base)
```
which will display
```
VGG(
  (features): Sequential(
    (0): Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (1): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (2): Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (3): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (4): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
    (5): Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (6): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (7): Conv2d(128, 128, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (8): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (9): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
    (10): Conv2d(128, 256, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (11): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (12): Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (13): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (14): Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (15): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (16): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
    (17): Conv2d(256, 512, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (18): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (19): Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (20): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (21): Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (22): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (23): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
    (24): Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (25): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (26): Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (27): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (28): Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (29): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (30): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
  )
  (avgpool): AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size=(7, 7))
  (classifier): Sequential(
    (0): Linear(in_features=25088, out_features=4096, bias=True)
    (1): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (2): Dropout(p=0.5, inplace=False)
    (3): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=True)
    (4): ReLU(inplace=True)
    (5): Dropout(p=0.5, inplace=False)
    (6): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=1000, bias=True)
  )
)
```
Notice that the model's architecture is divided into two parts - the feature detector (`features`) that has all the `Conv2d` layers and the classifier (`classifier`) that has all the `Linear` layers. Since the VGG16 model has been trained on a very huge images collection, we will typically like to keep the feature detector. Since our image dataset is much smaller, we would like to replace the classifier with a simpler/custom classifier of our own.

This is easily done using the following code:

```python
# we don't want to retrain our model against our images, so first 'freeze'
# all layers
for param in vgg16_base.features.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# define our custom classifier
custom_classifier = nn.Sequential(
    # Flatten(),
    # nn.Dropout(0.30),
    nn.Linear(512*7*7, 2048),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.10),      
    nn.Linear(2048, 1024),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.10),        
    nn.Linear(1024, 512),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.10),         
    nn.Linear(512, NUM_CLASSES)    
)

# replace vgg16_base's classifier with ours
vgg16_base.classifier = custom_classifier

# see what we got
print(vgg16_base)
```
This shows the following output - notice that the `classifier` section is our custom classifier rather than the original VGG16 classifier

### Training the model
So far whatever we have done is pure Pytorch (I mean, there is no `Pytk` _stuff_ added). Before we can train the model, let's add the `Pytk` _magic_ as follows:

```python
# wrap the model in an instance of PytkModuleWrapper
model = pytk.PytkModuleWrapper(vgg16_base)

LR_RATE, L2_REG = 0.001, 0.00002

# assign our loss function, optimizer & metrics we want to track
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(params=model.parameters(), lr=LR_RATE, momentum=0.0, 
                      nesterov=False, weight_decay=L2_REG)
model.compile(loss=criterion, optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['acc'])

# finally fit the model - since ImageFolder is a dataset, we'll use fit_dataset
NUM_EPOCHS, BATCH_SIZE = 50, 128

hist = model.fit_dataset(train_dataset, validation_dataset=eval_dataset,
                         epochs=NUM_EPOCHS, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE)
```
